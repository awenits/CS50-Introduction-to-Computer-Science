1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library that defines BYTE, DWORD, LONG and WORD data types.
2.  These data types are essentially aliases for C/C++ primitive data types. It makes clear that you intend to use the data a specific way.
	uint24_t means an integer that is exactly 24 bits wide.
3.  1 byte, 4 byte, 4 byte, 2 byte.
4.  The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes hexadecimal 0x4D42. 
5.  bfSize specifies the size of a file that contains a DIB [device-independent bitmap] and biSize specifies the size in bytes, of the BITMAPINFOHEADER.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap)
	and its origin is the upper left corner.
7.  The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the BMP's color depth.
8.  fopen might return NULL in line 24 if the file mentioned in its braces is not available and in line 32 it will return NULL,
    if it can't create the file (no memory space available).
9.  I think it is because the program is reading in 1 RGBTRIPLET OR 1 BITMAPINFOHEADER or 1 BITMAPFILEHEADER at a time.
10. value 3 will be assigned to padding.
11. Skips over any padding and looks for the next pixel (RGB triple).
12. This is an integer constant which, when used as the whence argument to the fseek or fseeko function,
	specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position.
